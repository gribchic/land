            <p>
                Employers must verify an employee's identity and establish that the worker is eligible to accept
                employment
                in the US. The stakes for non-compliance of federal immigration laws are so steep that many Hiring
                Managers
                and Human Resource departments are incorporating our I-9 software verification into their processes.
