In this case, the Requesting Party and/or Registered User shall ensure that\r\n                the Principal agrees that it shall use the verification only for the purpose stated in the Consent Form,\r\n                and shall make no further use or re-disclosure of the verification.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The information received from records maintained by SSA is protected by Federal statutes and\r\n                regulations, including 5 U.S.C. § 552a(i)(3) of the Privacy Act.
